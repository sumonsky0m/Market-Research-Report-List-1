<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Evaporative Cooler Installation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Downdraft</li><li>Sidedraft</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The evaporative cooler installation market is categorized primarily into downdraft and sidedraft systems. Downdraft coolers draw warm air in from above, cooling it and moving it downwards into the living space, making them suitable for larger areas. Sidedraft coolers, on the other hand, pull warm air in from the sides, cooling it as it passes through, and are often used in smaller or more confined spaces. Both types utilize natural evaporation to enhance indoor air quality and reduce temperatures efficiently.</p></p>
